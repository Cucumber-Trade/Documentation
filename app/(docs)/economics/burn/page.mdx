# Deflationary Mechanisms

CucumberTrade implements multiple deflationary mechanisms to reduce the circulating supply of `$CUKE` over time, creating long-term value for holders.

## Burn Sources

### 1. Fee Burns (Continuous)
20% of all protocol fees are used to buy `$CUKE` from the open market and send it to the burn address (`0x000...dead`). This happens automatically through the `FeeRouter` contract.

### 2. Arena Settlement Burns
When an arena settles, an additional 0.1% of the total arena volume is burned. This scales the burn rate with protocol activity.

### 3. Governance Burns
The governance system can vote to execute one-time burns from the treasury. This provides a mechanism for the community to accelerate deflation if desired.

## Burn Mechanics

```
Fee Collection → CUKE Buyback (DEX) → Transfer to Burn Address → Supply Reduced
```

The buyback is executed through a time-weighted average price (TWAP) strategy to minimize market impact:

1. Fees accumulate in the `BurnRouter` contract
2. Every 6 hours, a keeper triggers a TWAP buyback
3. Purchased tokens are sent to `0x000...000dead`
4. Burn event is emitted and indexed

## Burn Tracking

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Burned to Date | Updated on-chain |
| Burn Rate (30d avg) | Dynamic based on volume |
| Remaining Supply | Total Supply - Burned |
| Burn Address | `0x000...000dead` |

All burns are verifiable on-chain. The burn address has no private key, making token recovery impossible.

## Impact on Supply

As the protocol grows, the burn rate accelerates:
- Higher arena activity → more fees → more burns
- Governance can increase burn percentage
- Supply is permanently deflationary (no minting function exists)

The combination of fixed total supply, vesting unlocks, and continuous burns creates a supply curve that trends downward over the long term.
