# Fee Routing & Rewards

Every arena interaction generates fees that flow through the protocol. This system ensures fair distribution between creators, stakers, the treasury, and burn mechanisms.

## Trading Fee

A **1% fee** is applied to arena entries. This fee is split between the arena creator and the protocol's incentive pool:

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Arena Creator | 70% |
| ACP Incentives | 30% |

## Protocol Fee

A separate **15% protocol fee** is collected from each arena entry. This fee is distributed as follows:

```
Protocol Fee (15% of entry)
├── 50% → Treasury
├── 20% → Operating Expenses
├── 20% → Staking Incentives
└── 10% → Buyback / Burn
```

### Treasury (50%)
The largest share funds ecosystem development, partnerships, grants, and long-term protocol growth. Treasury spending is subject to governance oversight.

### Operating Expenses (20%)
Covers infrastructure costs, platform maintenance, and operational overhead required to run the protocol.

### Staking Incentives (20%)
Distributed to `$CUC` stakers proportional to their stake weight. This aligns token holders with protocol success.

### Buyback & Burn (10%)
Used to buy back `$CUC` from the open market and permanently burn it, reducing total supply over time. See [Deflationary Mechanisms](/economics/burn) for details.

## Worked Example

A typical arena with 50 participants and a 50 USDT buy-in:

```
Total Entry Pool:    50 × 50 USDT = 2,500 USDT
Trading Fee (1%):    25 USDT (17.50 to creator, 7.50 to ACP)
Protocol Fee (15%):  375 USDT
  → Treasury:        187.50 USDT
  → Operations:      75.00 USDT
  → Staking:         75.00 USDT
  → Buyback/Burn:    37.50 USDT
Prize Pool (85%):    2,125 USDT
```

## Reward Calculation

Staking rewards are proportional to your share of the total staked `$CUC`:

```
Your Reward = (Your Stake / Total Staked) × Staking Incentives Pool
```
