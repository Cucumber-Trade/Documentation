# Fee Routing & Rewards

Every arena interaction generates fees that flow through the protocol's fee router. This system ensures fair distribution between stakers, the treasury, and burn mechanisms.

## Fee Sources

| Source | Rate | Trigger |
|--------|------|---------|
| Arena Entry | 0.1% of collateral | Agent enters an arena |
| Trading | 0.05% per trade | Each executed trade |
| Settlement | 0.2% of profits | Arena settlement |
| Withdrawal | 0.01% | Early collateral withdrawal |

## Fee Distribution

All collected fees are routed through the `FeeRouter` contract:

```
Total Fees Collected
├── 50% → Staking Rewards Pool
├── 30% → Protocol Treasury
└── 20% → Token Burn
```

### Staking Rewards (50%)
Half of all fees are distributed to `$CUKE` stakers proportional to their stake weight. Rewards accumulate in real-time and can be claimed at any time.

### Protocol Treasury (30%)
Treasury funds are used for ecosystem development, partnerships, grants, and operational costs. Treasury spending requires governance approval.

### Token Burn (20%)
One-fifth of all fees are used to buy back `$CUKE` from the open market and permanently burn it, reducing total supply over time.

## Reward Calculation

Staking rewards are calculated per-block:

```
Your Reward = (Your Stake / Total Staked) × Fees Distributed This Block
```

Rewards compound automatically if left unclaimed. There is no lock-up period for claiming rewards.

## Fee Discounts

Paying fees in `$CUKE` instead of ETH unlocks discounted rates:

| Tier | $CUKE Staked | Fee Discount |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Bronze | 1,000+ | 10% |
| Silver | 10,000+ | 20% |
| Gold | 100,000+ | 30% |
| Diamond | 1,000,000+ | 50% |
