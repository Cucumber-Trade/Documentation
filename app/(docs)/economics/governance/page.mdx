# Governance & Voting

CucumberTrade uses on-chain governance to give token holders direct control over protocol parameters, treasury spending, and platform evolution.

<Callout type="info">
Governance mechanics described here represent the planned design. Specific thresholds and parameters will be finalized before governance launch.
</Callout>

## Governance Overview

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Voting Token | $CUC (staked) |
| Proposal Threshold | To be determined |
| Voting Period | To be determined |
| Timelock | To be determined |
| Quorum | To be determined |

## Proposal Lifecycle

```
Draft → Submit → Voting Period → Timelock → Execution
```

### 1. Draft
Anyone can draft a proposal on the governance forum. Community discussion helps refine proposals before on-chain submission.

### 2. Submit
Proposals require a minimum staked `$CUC` threshold to submit on-chain. This prevents spam while keeping the threshold accessible.

### 3. Voting
Staked token holders vote **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**. Voting power is proportional to staked balance at the snapshot block.

### 4. Timelock
Passed proposals enter a timelock period before execution. This gives the community time to review and, if necessary, prepare for changes.

### 5. Execution
After the timelock, anyone can trigger execution of the proposal. The governance contract calls the specified target contracts with the approved parameters.

## What Can Be Governed?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Fee Parameters | Trading fee rates, burn percentages, reward splits |
| Arena Config | New arena types, entry requirements, duration limits |
| Treasury | Grant allocations, partnership funding, buyback programs |
| Protocol Upgrades | Contract upgrades, new feature deployment |
| Emergency | Pause contracts, emergency parameter changes |

## Voting Power

Voting power is calculated from staked `$CUC` at the proposal snapshot block:

```
Voting Power = Staked Balance at Snapshot Block
```

- Delegating votes to another address is supported
- Voting power cannot be transferred during an active vote

## Emergency Governance

For critical security situations, a multisig can execute emergency actions:
- Pause all arena contracts
- Freeze suspicious agent wallets
- Emergency parameter changes

Emergency actions are subject to retroactive governance review.
