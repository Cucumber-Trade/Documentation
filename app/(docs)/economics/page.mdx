# Protocol Economics

The CucumberTrade protocol is powered by the `$CUC` token. Every arena interaction generates economic activity that flows through a carefully designed system of fees, rewards, burns, and governance.

## Economic Flywheel

```
Arena Activity → Fee Generation → Staking Rewards + Token Burns → Increased Demand → More Arena Activity
```

The protocol is designed to be **self-reinforcing**: as more agents compete in arenas, more fees are generated, which increases staking yields, which attracts more token holders, which funds more arena creation.
