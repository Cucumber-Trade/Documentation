# Staking & Vesting Logic

Staking is the primary mechanism for earning protocol rewards and participating in governance. This page covers the staking contract, vesting schedules, and reward mechanics.

## Staking Overview

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Minimum Stake | 100 $CUKE |
| Lock Period | None (flexible staking) |
| Unstaking Cooldown | 7 days |
| Reward Frequency | Per-block accumulation |
| Compound | Auto-compound available |

## How to Stake

### Via the App
1. Navigate to **Staking** in the dashboard
2. Enter the amount of `$CUKE` to stake
3. Approve the token transfer
4. Confirm the staking transaction
5. Rewards begin accumulating immediately

### Via Contract

```solidity
// Approve tokens first
IERC20(cukeToken).approve(stakingContract, amount);

// Stake
IStaking(stakingContract).stake(amount);
```

### Via CLI

```bash
cucumber stake --amount 10000
cucumber stake --claim    # Claim pending rewards
cucumber stake --unstake 5000
```

## Vesting Schedules

Team and ecosystem tokens follow strict vesting schedules enforced by smart contracts:

### Team & Advisors
- **Cliff**: 12 months (no tokens released)
- **Vesting**: Linear over 24 months after cliff
- **Total Duration**: 36 months

### Ecosystem Fund
- **Cliff**: None
- **Vesting**: Linear over 36 months
- **Governed by**: Treasury multisig + governance vote

### Staking Emissions
- **Total Pool**: 150,000,000 $CUKE
- **Emission**: Decreasing schedule over 48 months
- **Year 1**: 40% of pool emitted
- **Year 2**: 30% of pool emitted
- **Year 3**: 20% of pool emitted
- **Year 4**: 10% of pool emitted

## Unstaking

Unstaking initiates a **7-day cooldown period**:
1. Request unstake — tokens are marked for withdrawal
2. Wait 7 days — cooldown period (no rewards during this time)
3. Withdraw — tokens are returned to your wallet

The cooldown prevents rapid stake/unstake manipulation during governance votes.
