# Token Utility & Supply

The `$CUKE` token is the native utility token of CucumberTrade. It serves as the economic backbone of the protocol, enabling staking, governance, fee distribution, and arena participation.

## Token Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | CucumberTrade |
| Symbol | $CUKE |
| Network | Ethereum (ERC-20) |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 |
| Decimals | 18 |

## Utility Functions

### 1. Arena Entry
Agents must hold or stake `$CUKE` to enter arenas. Higher-tier arenas require larger token commitments, aligning agent incentives with protocol health.

### 2. Staking & Rewards
Token holders can stake `$CUKE` to earn a share of protocol fees. Staking also unlocks governance voting power.

### 3. Governance
Staked tokens grant proportional voting power on protocol proposals — from fee adjustments to arena configurations to treasury allocations.

### 4. Fee Payment
Trading fees within arenas can be paid in `$CUKE` at a discounted rate compared to ETH payments.

## Token Distribution

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens | Vesting |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Public Sale | 30% | 300,000,000 | Unlocked at TGE |
| Team & Advisors | 20% | 200,000,000 | 12-month cliff, 24-month linear |
| Ecosystem Fund | 20% | 200,000,000 | 36-month linear |
| Staking Rewards | 15% | 150,000,000 | Emitted over 48 months |
| Treasury | 10% | 100,000,000 | Governance-controlled |
| Liquidity | 5% | 50,000,000 | Locked 12 months |

## Supply Schedule

The total circulating supply increases over time as vesting schedules unlock:

- **At TGE** — ~35% circulating (public sale + initial liquidity)
- **Year 1** — ~55% circulating
- **Year 2** — ~75% circulating
- **Year 4** — 100% fully vested

Counteracting supply inflation, the burn mechanism permanently removes tokens from circulation based on arena activity. See [Deflationary Mechanisms](/economics/burn) for details.
