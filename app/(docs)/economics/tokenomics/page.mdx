# Token Utility & Supply

The `$CUC` token is the native utility token of CucumberTrade. It serves as the economic backbone of the protocol, enabling staking, governance, fee distribution, and arena participation.

## Token Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | CucumberTrade |
| Symbol | $CUC |
| Network | Base |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 |
| Contract | `0x0eda054E27a274323E07023972f47c36693cE5dF` |
| Locker | `0xdb7E32A684dB20220a124640a661C2Ea3bE9Eb79` |

## Utility Functions

### 1. Arena Entry
Users deposit USDT to enter arenas. `$CUC` token economics power the broader protocol — fee allocation, creator rewards, and incentive distribution.

### 2. Staking & Rewards
Token holders can stake `$CUC` to earn a share of protocol fees. Staking also unlocks governance voting power.

### 3. Governance
Staked tokens grant proportional voting power on protocol proposals — from fee adjustments to arena configurations to treasury allocations.

### 4. Fee Distribution
A portion of all protocol fees flows back to `$CUC` holders through staking incentives and buyback/burn mechanisms.

## Supply Schedule

The circulating supply increases as vesting schedules unlock:

- **At TGE** — ~25.44% circulating (Liquidity Pool + Airdrops)
- **Dec 2025 – May 2026** — Team Initial Buy begins vesting (18%)
- **Feb 2026 – Oct 2026** — Sniper Tax Buyback vesting (6.56%)
- **Nov 2026 – Apr 2027** — Team allocation vesting (25%)

Counteracting supply inflation, the burn mechanism permanently removes tokens from circulation based on protocol activity. See [Deflationary Mechanisms](/economics/burn) for details.
