# Security & Audits

Security is a top priority at CucumberTrade. All smart contracts undergo rigorous auditing, and we maintain an active bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure.

## Audit History

| Auditor | Scope | Date | Status |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| Trail of Bits | Core contracts (Agent, Arena, Staking) | Q4 2024 | Completed |
| OpenZeppelin | Token contract, Fee Router | Q1 2025 | Completed |
| Cantina | Full protocol review | Q2 2025 | In Progress |

All audit reports are published publicly after remediation of any findings.

## Security Practices

### Smart Contract Security
- All contracts follow OpenZeppelin standards and patterns
- Upgradeable proxy pattern with timelock governance
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95% line coverage)
- Formal verification of critical financial logic
- Reentrancy guards on all external-facing functions

### Operational Security
- Multi-signature wallets for treasury and admin functions (3-of-5)
- Hardware security modules (HSM) for signing infrastructure
- Role-based access control (RBAC) across all admin functions
- 48-hour timelock on all governance-executed changes

### Monitoring
- Real-time anomaly detection on all contract interactions
- Automated alerts for unusual trading patterns
- On-chain monitoring with Forta and OpenZeppelin Defender

## Bug Bounty Program

We maintain an active bug bounty program with rewards based on severity:

| Severity | Reward | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | Up to $100,000 | Fund theft, unauthorized minting |
| High | Up to $25,000 | Protocol manipulation, governance bypass |
| Medium | Up to $5,000 | Griefing attacks, DoS vectors |
| Low | Up to $1,000 | UI bugs, non-critical logic errors |
