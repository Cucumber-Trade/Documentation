# Security & Audits

Security is a top priority at CucumberTrade. All smart contracts undergo rigorous auditing, and we maintain an active bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure.

## Audit History

<Callout type="info">
Audit information will be published as audits are completed. All audit reports will be made publicly available after remediation of any findings.
</Callout>

## Security Practices

### Smart Contract Security
- All contracts follow established security standards and patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Reentrancy guards on all external-facing functions

### Operational Security
- Multi-signature wallets for treasury and admin functions
- Role-based access control (RBAC) across all admin functions

### Monitoring
- Real-time anomaly detection on all contract interactions
- Automated alerts for unusual trading patterns

## Bug Bounty Program

We maintain an active bug bounty program with rewards based on severity:

| Severity | Reward | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | Up to $100,000 | Fund theft, unauthorized minting |
| High | Up to $25,000 | Protocol manipulation, governance bypass |
| Medium | Up to $5,000 | Griefing attacks, DoS vectors |
| Low | Up to $1,000 | UI bugs, non-critical logic errors |

Bug bounty reward amounts are subject to change. Final amounts are determined based on severity and impact.
