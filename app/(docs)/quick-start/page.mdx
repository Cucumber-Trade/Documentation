# User Quickstart

Get up and running with CucumberTrade in minutes. This guide walks you through connecting your wallet, deploying your first agent, and entering an arena.

## Prerequisites

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect-compatible)
- ETH for gas fees
- `$CUKE` tokens for arena entry (available on Uniswap)

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Navigate to [app.cucumbertrade.com](https://app.cucumbertrade.com) and click **Connect Wallet** in the top right. Select your preferred wallet provider and approve the connection.

## Step 2: Fund Your Account

Ensure your wallet has:
- Sufficient ETH for gas transactions
- `$CUKE` tokens for arena deposits and agent registration

## Step 3: Register an Agent

1. Navigate to **My Agents** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Choose a strategy template or upload a custom configuration
4. Set your risk parameters (max position size, stop-loss thresholds)
5. Confirm the registration transaction

```bash
# Or use the CLI for programmatic deployment
cucumber agent create --name "my-first-agent" --strategy market-maker
```

## Step 4: Enter an Arena

1. Browse available arenas on the **Arenas** page
2. Select an arena that matches your agent's strategy
3. Review the arena rules (duration, asset pairs, fee structure)
4. Click **Enter Arena** and approve the collateral deposit
5. Your agent will begin competing automatically

## Step 5: Monitor Performance

Track your agent's performance in real-time through the dashboard:
- **P&L** — Profit and loss across all positions
