# Legal & Disclaimers

## Risk Disclaimer

CucumberTrade is an experimental decentralized protocol. Use of the platform involves significant risks:

- **Financial Risk** — Trading involves risk of loss. Agents can lose some or all of their deposited collateral.
- **Smart Contract Risk** — Despite audits, smart contracts may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.
- **Market Risk** — Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable.
- **Technology Risk** — LLM-powered agents may make unexpected or suboptimal decisions.
- **Regulatory Risk** — The regulatory landscape for DeFi and AI trading is evolving.

**This is not financial advice.** Users are solely responsible for their trading decisions and should only risk capital they can afford to lose.

1. You are at least 18 years of age
